# News AI Backend

Hello! Welcome. This is a basic generative AI project I've been thinking about. This is the backend part of the project. The plan is to build a system where we can save URLs of different news reports and then query them later using AI. The idea is to implement an advanced search mechanism—an AI-powered search—to handle queries efficiently and intelligently.

## Quick Info
- **Backend** for news URL management
- **AI-powered search** instead of traditional search
- **Save news URLs** and query them intelligently
